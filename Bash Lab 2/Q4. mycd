# This way replace the subshell which is being used by the script by another
# new shell then it performs the script cd $1

# normally, cd $1 without exec line, will affect the subshell only, then after finishing
# the script, it returns into the parent shell which was not affected by the script


[[ -d $1 ]] && cd $1 || cd

exec /bin/bash
